# Stroke-prediction
stroke occurs when the supply of blood to the brain is reduced or blocked completely, which prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients.In this project I had build a Machine Learning project that can predict whether a patient will get stroke or not based on few parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.During model building I came across various data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection, Exploratory Data Analysis ,k fold cross validation to get the best model score etc.

# Technologies used:
1.Python as language                                                                                                                                                                   
2.Pandas for data cleaning                                                                                                                                                             
3.Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization                                                                                                                                        
4.Sklearn for model building                                                                                                                                                           
5.Jupyter notebook as IDE
